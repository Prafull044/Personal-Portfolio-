            <h3> Competition 1</h3>
            <span>My friend Atharva Misale and I had the honor of securing the runners-up position in the National Level
                Webpage Design Competition held at Jagadambha College of Engineering Yavatmal. This competition proved
                to be an enriching experience, offering us valuable insights into webpage design and development. As a
                testament to our achievement, we were awarded a certificate and a trophy, which symbolize our hard work
                and dedication. It was a proud moment and an excellent opportunity to enhance our skills and knowledge
                in a competitive environment.</span>

                <h3>Competition 2</h3>
                <span>I had the privilege of securing the winner's position in the Circuit Design Competition held at
                    Darda
                    Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yavatmal. This achievement reflects my strong aptitude in
                    electronics and my ability to apply technical knowledge effectively. As a recognition of this
                    accomplishment, I was awarded a certificate and a trophy.</span>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <span>My first project, NeetJunction.com is a comprehensive website designed specifically for NEET students.
                The platform offers video tutorials, handwritten notes, quiz games, and previous years' question papers
                (PYQs), making it a one-stop solution for addressing the challenges faced by NEET aspirants. I
                integrated a YouTube playlist to provide seamless access to video tutorials, enhancing the learning
                experience for users. Developing this website allowed me to gain substantial knowledge and a deeper
                understanding of web development concepts, while also honing my problem-solving skills.</span>

            </div>



            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <span>I created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS, which showcases my skills, projects, and
                achievements. Working on this project gave me the chance to apply my knowledge of web development and
                improve my design skills.

                During the process, I learned how to create responsive layouts and design user-friendly web pages. It
                helped me understand important concepts like organizing content, styling elements, and ensuring the
                website looks good on different devices.

                This project was a great learning experience, and it gave me confidence in building websites. It also
                motivated me to keep learning and improving my skills in web development.</span>
